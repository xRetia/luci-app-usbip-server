# luci-app-usbip-server

[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](README.md)

## Project Description

luci-app-usbip-server is a comprehensive OpenWRT LuCI application designed specifically for network sharing of USB devices. With this plugin, you can easily configure your OpenWRT device as a USBIP server, enabling network sharing of USB devices and allowing multiple client devices to remotely access and use USB devices connected to the server.

```

2. Configure and compile:
```bash
make menuconfig
# Select luci-app-usbip-server in LuCI -> Applications
make package/luci-app-usbip-server/compile V=s
```

### Manual Installation

```

3. Install the package:
```bash
opkg install luci-app-usbip-server_1.0.1-1_all.ipk
```

## Usage

### Web Interface Management

1. Log in to LuCI administration interface
2. Navigate to **Services** ‚Üí **USBIP Server**
3. Configure the following options:

**Basic Settings:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable USBIP Server** - Enable/disable the entire service
- üî¢ **Server Port** - USBIP service listening port (default: 3240)

**Device Registration Mode:**
- üåê **All Devices** - Share all connected USB devices
- ‚úÖ **Specific Devices (Whitelist)** - Share only selected devices
- ‚ùå **All Except Specific Devices (Blacklist)** - Share all devices except selected ones

**USB Device List:**
- In whitelist or blacklist mode, select devices to include or exclude from the list

### Client Connection

**Windows Client:**
1. Install [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2)
2. View available USB devices:
```cmd
usbip list -r <OpenWRT_Device_IP>
```
3. Connect device:
```cmd
usbip attach -r <OpenWRT_Device_IP> -b <device_busid>
```

**Linux Client:**
1. Load USBIP kernel modules:
```bash
modprobe usbip-core
modprobe vhci-hcd
```
2. View available devices:
```bash
usbip list -r <OpenWRT_Device_IP>
```
3. Connect device:
```bash
usbip attach -r <OpenWRT_Device_IP> -b <device_busid>
```

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Device Management
- **Real-time Monitoring Mechanism** - Monitors USB device hot-plug status through an event-driven approach
- **Device Information Collection** - Automatically retrieves and displays detailed device information (manufacturer, model, device ID, etc.)
- **Auto-binding Policy** - Automatically handles newly connected USB devices according to configured management policies

### Service Optimization
- **Resource Management** - Optimized for embedded devices to minimize CPU and memory usage
- **Conflict Detection** - Automatically detects and resolves potential conflicts with system services
- **Exception Recovery** - Automatic recovery capability when the service unexpectedly terminates
- **Logging** - Detailed operation and error logs for easy troubleshooting

## Configuration File Description

Main configuration file path:
```
/etc/config/usbip_server  # Main configuration file
```

Configuration items:
- `enabled` - Whether to enable the service (0=disabled, 1=enabled)
- `port` - USBIP server listening port (default: 3240)
- `device_mode` - Device registration mode (all=all devices, whitelist=whitelist, blacklist=blacklist)
- `devices` - Device list, used in whitelist/blacklist mode

## Performance and Security

### Performance Considerations
- It is recommended to use in environments with sufficient network bandwidth, especially when sharing large-capacity storage devices
- There may be latency for devices with high-frequency data transmission (such as cameras, audio devices)
- The monitoring service has extremely low resource consumption, typically less than 1% CPU and a few MB of memory

### Security Recommendations
- It is recommended to use this service in a trusted network environment
- Consider using a firewall to restrict access to the USBIP service port to specific IPs only
- Regularly update your OpenWRT system and this plugin to obtain security updates
- For sensitive devices, it is recommended to use whitelist mode to precisely control access permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Device Binding Fails**
- Check if kernel modules are properly loaded: `lsmod | grep usbip`
- Confirm USB devices are visible in the system: `lsusb` or check `/sys/bus/usb/devices/`

**2. Client Cannot Connect**
- Ensure firewall allows TCP connections on USBIP port (default 3240)
- Verify service is running: `ps | grep usbipd`

**3. Device List is Empty**
- Check if USB devices are properly connected
- Confirm USB controller drivers are loaded

### Log Viewing
```bash
# View monitor service logs
logread | grep usbip-monitor

# View system logs
logread
```
